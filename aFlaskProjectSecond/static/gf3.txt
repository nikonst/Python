The Godfather Part III

The Godfather Part III was released on December 25, 1990. Francis Ford Coppola returned as director for the
feature-length film, while also writing the screenplay with the help of the author Mario Puzo.
It completes the story of Michael Corleone, a Mafia kingpin who tries to legitimize his criminal empire,
and shows the rise of Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son Vincent Corleone as Michael's successor.
The film also weaves into its plot a fictionalized account of real-life events, which include
the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981 and 1982, and links them with
each other and with the affairs of Michael Corleone.
