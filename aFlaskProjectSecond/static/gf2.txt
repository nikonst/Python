The Godfather Part II

The Godfather Part II was released on December 20, 1974. The feature-length film was again directed by
Francis Ford Coppola and based upon Mario Puzo's novel of the same name. The film is in part both a sequel
and a prequel to The Godfather, presenting two parallel dramas. The main storyline, following the first
film's events, centers on Michael Corleone, the new Don of the Corleone crime family, trying to hold
his business ventures together from 1958 to 1959; the other is a series of flashbacks following
his father, Vito Corleone, from his childhood in Sicily in 1901 to his founding of the Corleone
family in New York City.
